## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1:
dBm stands for decibel-milliwatt, and is used to describe the signal strength of a wifi signal.
between -50 to -70 dBm is considered good, below -80 to -90dbm is considered bad

Answer for Question 2:
the actual command/directories used by each os will be different, hence we need a different command. Whatever is returned/printed is also different

Answer for Question 3:
runs the passed commands and takes its output. essentially just runs the command in a new thread, and then pipes its output into a variable.

Answer for Question 4:
searches a string based on given regex, returns a matching substring from the string.

Answer for Question 5:
we want dbm, but the units weren't originally in dbm
windows reports a percentage.

Answer for Question 6:
Measures variability/spread in data
Higher std dev = more variation in signal strength
Useful to understand stability of WiFi signal at each location
Helps identify locations with inconsistent signal

Answer for Question 7:
2D labeled data structure
Like spreadsheet/SQL table
Benefits:
Easy data manipulation
Built-in statistical functions
Simple integration with plotting libraries
Clean data organization

Answer for Question 8:
Show uncertainty/variation in measurements
Length = 1 standard deviation up/down
Important because:
Indicates signal stability
Shows measurement reliability
Helps compare locations statistically

Answer for Question 9:
Signal strength typically:
Decreases with distance from router
Weakens through walls/floors
Affected by:
Building materials
Electronic interference
Physical obstacles
Router placement
